    <h2>Game Development Addendum</h2>
    <p>
        This Space Adventure game is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" style interactive story where players make decisions that determine the outcome of their journey. The game consists of multiple stages, each with a series of choices, leading to different outcomes or endings. The player starts by landing on an unknown planet and must choose between exploring a cave or ancient ruins. The decisions made throughout the game will either lead to success or failure.
    </p>

    <h3>Process and Creative Choices</h3>
    <p>
        During the development of the game, I focused on creating a simple but engaging narrative where each choice could branch into multiple paths, giving the player a sense of control over the story. I chose a science-fiction theme for the game, setting it on a distant planet with mysterious creatures, ancient ruins, and unexpected traps. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Challenges Faced and Solutions</h3>
    <p>
        One of the main challenges I faced during development was organizing the logic for the branching story paths. It was important to structure the code in a way that would allow for flexibility in the decision tree and ensure that each consequence was properly linked to the next stage of the game. To manage this, I used a JavaScript object to store the different stages of the game along with the available choices and their consequences.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
    <p>
        In the future, I plan to add more complex features to the game, such as adding images or animations that change based on the player's decisions. I could also introduce time-based challenges or puzzles that require the player to think critically. Furthermore, I would like to incorporate a scoring system to reward players for making successful decisions, adding a new layer of interaction to the game.
