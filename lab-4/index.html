 <h1 align="center">SMART TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>
 <p>This project is an acknowledgement to the inspiration, drive and technical 
 assistance contributed by many individuals. This project would have never seen light 
 of this day without the help and guidance I have received. I would like to express our 
 gratitude to all the people behind the screen who helped me to transform an idea into a 
 real application.</p>
 <h2 align="center"><b>ABSTRACT</b></h2>
 <p><b><i>Traffic congestion is increasingly becoming a severe problem in many large 
 cities around the world. The problem is more complex in developing countries where 
 cities are growing much faster than those in the developed countries. With the increase 
 of population, the traffic is also being increased day by day. It has become a hell kind 
 of experience in these days to go out in the peak hours, mostly in the metropolitan cities. 
 It takes hours to go to a near place where there have been number of traffic signal 
 junctions. At present the traffic control system is following the timer system in which 
 a particular time period is defined for the vehicles to move. By this we may not exactly 
 clear the traffic, because the traffic may not be constant in all the directions. So here is 
 the project to control the traffic depending on the density (i.e., more number of vehicles) 
 at the signal junctions.</i></b></p>
 <p><b><i>This project has been designed by using four IR sensors for four approaching 
 roads at a signal junction. These IR sensors count the number of vehicles in each 
 direction and give this information to the microcontroller. Depending on the 
 information received, the controller takes the decision to give green signal to those 
 particular direction vehicles whose density is much higher than other directions and 
 allows them. And the rest of the signals will be in red for the duration of period defined 
 in the controller. Likewise, the priority is given to that particular direction whose 
 density is more and clears the traffic. Then the controller again checks the sensor inputs 
 and will give signals appropriately depending on the density.</i></b></p> 
 <p><b><i>The emergency vehicles like ambulance, fire engine, etc the communication 
 system installed in the vehicles can clutch the traffic at signals until they cross the signal 
 post. The system is designed for junction/cross-roads, where often ambulance has to 
 wait until the normal traffic is cleared. This is quite inconvenience for the patient who 
 needs immediate treatment. There by this system is designed which can by-pass the 
 existing signaling system temporarily.</i></b></p>
 <p><b><i>As the embedded system can identify the approaching direction, except this way 
 signal for the remaining three ways will be red, there by traffic will be clutched and 
 way for the emergency vehicle will be cleared. During normal time these indicators 
 remains in off condition, whenever the emergency vehicle is approaching from a 
 specific direction, the driver has to activate the corresponding key from the transmitter. 
 Likewise, all four sides’ traffic can be controlled according to the approaching direction 
 of the emergency vehicle. After crossing the junction (signal post), simply by pressing 
 reset key from the emergency vehicle, the signals are restored automatically. The same 
 system can be implemented in VVIP vehicles also.</i></b></p>
 <h2 align="center"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h2>
 <p>The development of intelligent traffic control systems has become increasingly 
 vital due to the burgeoning number of vehicles on the road and the perpetual need for 
 safety and efficiency. Modern traffic engineering involves dynamic analysis and 
 synthesis of automotive technologies to manage traffic systems effectively. In this 
 context, the project emphasizes the creation of reliable control structures for urban and 
 motorway traffic, leveraging advanced technologies like communication networks and 
 sophisticated algorithms to optimize traffic light controllers. This approach aims not 
 only to minimize waiting times for road users but also to provide them with information 
 to navigate cities more efficiently, thereby reducing fuel consumption and 
 environmental impact.

 <p>The required PCB’S (Printed Circuit boards) for the project work fabricated by 
 SUN RISE CIRCUITS, Kushaiguda Industrial Estate, Hyderabad. Kushaiguda 
 Industrial Estate is very famous for fabricating the Industrial grade PCB’s. The project 
 utilizes Atmel 89C51 and 89C2051 Micro Controller ICs for processing, LM567 Tone 
 Decoder for audio signal detection, RF Transmitter and Receiver for wireless 
 communication, Voltage Regulator IC (7805) for stable power supply, BC547 NPN 
 Transistors for signal control, and Relays for switching high-power devices.</p>
 <h2 align="center"><b>CONCLUSION</b></h2>
 <p>The successful development of the prototype module demonstrates its potential 
 for various applications. However, further modifications are necessary to enhance its 
 functionality and reliability. Future improvements should focus on using higher-quality 
 components to meet operational requirements effectively. Additionally, expanding the 
 module's capabilities to accommodate real-world scenarios, such as integrating sensors 
 for more accurate detection of emergency vehicles and optimizing traffic flow 
 algorithms, would be beneficial.</p>
